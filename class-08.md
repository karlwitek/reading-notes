Links

Use links in html code to link to other pages on the web or to other sections of the web page you are creating.

Links are created by using the 'a' tag.  href is the attribute placed inside the tag that specifies a URL to 
a separate site or a relative URL to link to other sections of the page you are creating.  A relative URL is used 
to link to another page of the site you are creating.

The text provided between the 'a' tags will be what is seen by the user.  This text is the link that the user will click
on.  It is good practice to make the text descriptive to make the page more user friendly.  When using a URL that links 
to a different site, it is called an Absolute URL.  Again, the relative URL is when a link takes the user to another
part of the page or page within your site.

If the link is stored in the same folder as the rest of your files that create the page, the address within the href
will simply be the name of the file.  (href="contacts.html" for example)  If creating a large site, it is a good idea 
to store different pages in separate folders.  These folders take on a parent/child/grandchild relationship.  The files
contained in each folder are accessed with another forward slash and the name of the file.  

In this example: href="destinations/cities/dining.html" , destinations is the child 
folder, cities is the grandchild folder, and dining.html is the file contained in the folder cities.
This is a relative URL. The parent folder is not entered.  It is the location currently on.
