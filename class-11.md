Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search engine optimization is the process of including
items in your site to help it receive good search engine
results when users look for topics related to your site.

There is on-page and off-page techniques to accomplish this.
Off-page techniques have to do with how many other sites 
link to yours.  Your site's ranking is partially determined 
by the number of other sites that links to yours.

On-page techniques involves keywords that users are likely
to enter into a search engine.  These keywords need to be 
in the text and HTML code of your site.  There are seven 
essential places that your keywords should appear. 

Page Title: the title lives in the 'title' element which is 
inside the 'head' element towards the top of your HTML code.

URL/WEB address:  the name of the file is part of the URL. If
possible, include keywords in the file name.

Headings: having keywords in the heading element will gain
extra weight over other text

Text:  try to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text
2-3 times if possible. Careful to not over use these terms for
readability.

Link Text:  use keywords in the text that creates the links. Avoid
using 'click here'

Image Alt Text:  descriptions of images should appear in the alt 
attribute of image tags.  This text will be used when users search for
images.

Page Descriptions:  page descriptions are in the 'meta' tag which is 
inside the 'head' tag.  It should be a sentence that describes the 
content of the page. This description will not show up in the browser,
but may be used by the search engine.
